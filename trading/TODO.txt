Check if logic to set EventId is incorrect.

0. Get the loopback event to work.
And how do we send input and output events to the chronicle for logging?
( what should be the structure of the ResponeEvent)

1. Set up TCP replication of logs for Chronicle.
All the input and output events will be stored and replicated.
Only use those MarketData events which are tested (used or unused) by a Strategy.

2. Using fake market data, set up aggregation and smart order routing.

3. Should StrategyManager also have reference to outbound dispatcher (it needs it to signal errors).
Or should we have a responseManager which will have reference to outbound dispatcher.
Strategy and StrategyManger can use its static method to send out Trader Updates?

1. Set up ElasticSearch/Kibana and set up dashboard to track an Order.
