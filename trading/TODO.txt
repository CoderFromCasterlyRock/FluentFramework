1. Add a formatter!!



4. Recovery when the container restarts!
Check if logic to set EventId is incorrect.
Check if which input/output events should be played in.

0. Get the loopback event to work.
And how do we send input and output events to the chronicle for logging?
( what should be the structure of the ResponeEvent)

2. Using fake market data, set up aggregation and smart order routing.

3. Should StrategyManager also have reference to outbound dispatcher (it needs it to signal errors).
Or should we have a responseManager which will have reference to outbound dispatcher.
Strategy and StrategyManger can use its static method to send out Trader Updates?

==================================================
1. Set up ElasticSearch/Kibana and set up dashboard to track an Order.


==================================================

Transport class:
	1) Responsible for connecting to the underlying class specified by the Type.
	2) Has a list of listeners (FluentDataListener generally implementd by the adaptor), to which it sends messages as it receives.


Adaptor class:
	1) gets data from Transport and converts it to Event usign a decoder.
	2) Sends events out via the manager.
	

Manager class:
	1) Reads and stores relevants properties.
	2) creates Transport and adaptor and binds them
	3) Registers listenrs for events and forards them to adaptor
	4) gets events from Adaptor and sends to dispatcher
